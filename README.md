# Project-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-MLP-Model

Imagine having the power to understand human emotions from audio files. Our cutting-edge system is designed to do just that, employing MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) classifiers and built using Python. Here's what our Speech-Emotion Recognition system can offer:

Key Features:

Emotion Recognition: Our system can accurately identify a range of human emotions from audio files, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This capability is particularly valuable for applications like sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and mental health assessments.

Audio Input: Simply provide an audio file as input, and our system will analyze the emotional content within it. This makes it versatile and compatible with various audio formats.

MLP Classifiers: We've harnessed the power of Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers, a type of neural network, to make precise emotion predictions. These classifiers are well-known for their ability to handle complex patterns and relationships in data.

Python-Powered: Built with Python, a popular and versatile programming language, our system is not only efficient but also highly customizable. You can easily integrate it into your existing Python-based projects or applications.

User-Friendly Interface: Our system comes with an intuitive interface that makes it accessible for both developers and non-technical users. Analyzing emotions in audio files has never been this straightforward.
